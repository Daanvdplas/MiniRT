# Progress

MiniRT was a really cool project. It required math knowledge regarding vectors, matrix multiplications and geometry. The difficult thing with such programs is that you can easily lose track if you just copy formulas from the internet. With writing software you need to understand every bit of your code otherwise you work very inefficient. In addition, the importance of teamwork came to light very strong. Equal effort, good communication and a positive attitude is something I find very important. On the whole I learned a lot during this project, both hard and soft skills. However, it is not something I'm proud of. The project became a mess and because I am more interested in other subjects, I decided to finish it and move on.
